**Cryptography using Kotlin Language**

Basically here I use some Libs of Kotlin, this libs are from Javax

`import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
import kotlin.experimental.and`

> The code does not differ much from the languages

Cryptografy is I a simple way, encryption is a set of techniques designed to protect information so that only sender and receiver can understand it.
